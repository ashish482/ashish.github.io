Sugar!! What comes up in your mind when you hear this word. Do the taste buds respond to the image of it? I'll probably consider it a yes. The sweets we eat while celebrating, the soft drinks we consume almost every week, the packaged food we love to carry while on trips, everything has some or more amount of sugar in it. But what if I told you that the taste you enjoy is taking away years from your life . Sugar has a bittersweet reputation when it comes to health. Sugar occurs naturally in all foods that contain carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables, grains, and dairy. Adult men take in an average of 24 teaspoons of added sugar per day, according to the National Cancer Institute. That's equal to 384 calories. In a study published in 2014 in JAMA Internal Medicine, Dr. Hu and his colleagues found an association between a high-sugar diet and a greater risk of dying from heart disease. Over the course of the 15-year study, people who got 17% to 21% of their calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease compared with those who consumed 8% of their calories as added sugar.

## I want to lose fat and do not want to hit the gym!
Are you one of them who wants to lose up belly fat and not hit the gym, feel more energised annd focussed? No am not going to teach you a magic trick, rather I ll share with you a personal story.

It was year 2017. I weighted 97 kgs and was progressing towards a century. I felt lazy enough to get up, work, go to college and did feel sleepy throughout the day. Scrolling through Facebook, I saw a photo of my childhood friend who I wasn't in contact with. Back then he was the skinniest of all in school. The photo however depicted another story. My friend had transformed his body from a skinny to an aesthetic build with huge arms, legs, and deltoids. Looking in the mirror and watching that fat jiggle made me crazy. I had no access to gym at that moment, neither I was ready for it. I did hear people saying throughout my teenage "it's sugar which makes you fat" and bam there was my first attempt to get fit. I decided to gamble upon sugar. I tried cutting it off as much as I could. Little did I know, I started observing certain changes in my body weight.

## What the fuss is all about
My friends at college wondered how I was shredding fat without hitting the gym. To be honest even I had no idea until I studied the harmful effects that sugar causes to our body. 
For instance, high amounts of sugar overload the liver. "Your liver metabolizes sugar the same way as alcohol, and converts dietary carbohydrates to fat," says Dr. Hu. Over time, this can lead to a greater accumulation of fat, which may turn into fatty liver disease, a contributor to diabetes, which raises your risk for heart disease. Consuming too much added sugar can raise blood pressure and increase chronic inflammation, both of which are pathological pathways to heart disease. Excess consumption of sugar, especially in sugary beverages, also contributes to weight gain by tricking your body into turning off its appetite-control system because liquid calories are not as satisfying as calories from solid foods. This is why it is easier for people to add more calories to their regular diet when consuming sugary beverages.

## Avoiding the sweetest poison
Reading food labels is one of the best ways to monitor your intake of added sugar. Look for the following names for added sugar and try to either avoid, or cut back on the amount or frequency of the foods where they are found. Also, keep track of sugar you add to your food or beverages. About half of added sugar comes from beverages, including coffee and tea. A study in the May 2017 Public Health found that about two-thirds of coffee drinkers and one-third of tea drinkers put sugar or sugary flavorings in their drinks. The researchers also noted that more than 60% of the calories in their beverages came from added sugar

## How much is okay
Well Life is not about quitting things, it's about doing everything sustainably. When it comes to sugar, everybody may question "How much is okay?". The answer does depend on the fitness regime you are in but for a normal human being with minimal exercise about 8 teaspoons or 32 grams is the maximum limit. Anything beneath this limit will make you losen up the belly fat you have been carrying since long.
